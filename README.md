# Golang_project

# For first steps I am following the Go tutorials from learncodeonline.in

# Added a few steps myself, like HRMS with Fiber and PostgreSQL in GO

# This was now the last commit in Golang_Project, where i was learning Go syntax and some DB usage
# I will now continue to create a new repo for each go project where i will try to improve my Go skills
